<h1 class="home-title">About Visualizze</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to Visualizze! The purpose of this webapp is to be used as a tool for those looking to easily visualize their data.
    However, it is mainly targeted towards data professionals, who are familiar with all the different factors related to creating 
    a meaningful visual. But this doesnt mean it cant be used by non-professionals as well!
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Using Visualizze's easy to navigate interface, you can simply upload your .csv or .xlsx data file, 
    select the data columns you wish to visualize, and then leave the rest to Visualizze! Once the various plots are generated Visualizze will
    render them on the visualization dashboard for you to choose from, where you can then download the visual for your own personal use.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Please do note though that Visualizze tries its best to process your data before visualization. However, this can prove a little 
    difficult sometimes. So please, do try to upload data that has already been cleaned and processed as much as possible, 
    in order for Visualizze to be able to generate you a satisfying visualization.
</p>
